# Probability

1. Probability
   * Sample Space
   
     * A set of points which are the possible **outcomes** of a **trial**.
   
   * Event
   
     * A subset of a sample space.
   
   * Probability
     * A map from events to real numbers
       * $ P(A) \geq 0$ for all events
       
       * $P(X) = 1$
       
       * If $A \cap B = \emptyset$ for two events $A$ and $B$ then
         $$
         P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
         $$
     
   * Probability mass function
   
     * A map from points in the sample space to real numbers
       * $p(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in X$
       * $\sum_{x \in A}p(x) = 1$
   
   * $P(A)=\sum_{x\in A}p(x)$
   
   * If all the points in a sample space have the same probability then
     $$
     P(A)=\frac{\mbox{number of points in }A}{\mbox{number of points in }X}=\frac{\#A}{\#X}
     $$
     where $\#(A)$ means the number of points in $A$.
   
   * The **binomial coefficient**(Combination)
     $$
     \left(\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right)=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
     $$
